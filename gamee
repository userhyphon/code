The storyline follows as you navigate a dysoptian world——a place destroyed after natural calamities. In this place, there are 2 major factions: the Mercenary Faction and the Scholar Faction. You are a part of the Scholar Faction
            
You will go about your day, making various choices. Your actions will impact the storyline as well as the endings you earn; there are FOUR endings in total.

At the start of the game, you are set reputation points, and certain relationship points with the interactable characters. You are also set personality points.

Your actions will either increase or decrease these points. These points are important——they will influence storypaths.

You are given an inventory to store items, should you choose to collect them. These items may help you later on.

What you do matters——the fate of the world lies in \x1B[3myour\x1B[0m hands. Discover what secrets the world holds, as the secrets of your past.
